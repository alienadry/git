pro tips:
        #pro tip for writing commit message: before writing commit message, put it in this sentence: this code will ------ .and whatever is the answer, is the commit message.
        #leting git know the changes: stage => commit. stage means add the folder has been changed and then commit.
        #once a merge happend in pull request, you can delete the old branch(that has allready merged to the main branch)/remember to have a 0 commits ahead and the delete the branch.
        #in the branches part of github, you can see sth has 2 number with 'behind' and 'ahead' titles, behind means the number of commits in branche, and ahead means zero commits left for merging, so if the ahead part is 0, it means its fully merged.
        #when a merge conflict happened, you can fix it by using git merge main, that gonna bring the main(with the other branch merged) to your branch and lets you compare them and merge them together
